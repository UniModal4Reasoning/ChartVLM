# ChartX & ChartVLM
Recently, many versatile Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged continuously. However, their capacity to query information depicted in visual charts and engage in reasoning based on the queried contents remains under-explored. In this paper, to comprehensively and rigorously benchmark the ability of the off-the-shelf MLLMs in the chart domain, we construct ChartX, a multi-modal evaluation set covering 18 chart types, 7 chart tasks, 22 disciplinary topics, and high-quality chart data. Besides, we develop ChartVLM to offer a new perspective on handling multi-modal tasks that strongly depend on interpretable patterns such as reasoning tasks in the field of charts or geometric images. We evaluate the chart-related ability of mainstream MLLMs and our ChartVLM on the proposed ChartX evaluation set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ChartVLM surpasses both versatile and chart-related large models, achieving results comparable to GPT-4V. We believe that our study can pave the way for further exploration in creating a more comprehensive chart evaluation set and developing more interpretable multi-modal models.

## Release

- [2024/2/21] ðŸ”¥ We have released the ChartX benchmark [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d6zyH3kIwgepTqR0fc67xzyUtblrvOIX/view) to evaluate the chart-related capabilities of the existing MLLMS. We divide the entire ChartX benchmark into 4,848 validation samples, [ChartX_annotation_val.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13jwSO8kaAnbPujECQK9x2QA_TXByzzYH/view?usp=sharing) and 1,152 test samples, [ChartX_annotation_test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kOEi5Kca7WnFhBGyJlBIEtlgaIk004o0/view?usp=sharing). Results reported in Table 2 to 5 are evaluated on test samples. The evaluation log is shown [here](eval/eval_result_SE_on_ChartX.log).

## ChartVLM Overall: 
- **(1)** To enhance the interpretability of the chart model in cognition tasks (e.g. answer questions based on chart image), ChartVLM first performs the base perception task (e.g. structural extraction from the given chart image to a predicted CSV data), and then, finishes other cognition tasks (e.g. chart redrawing, description, summary, and QA) based on the extracted structural data. 
- **(2)** To choose the task that users expect to perform according to the used prompts, the instruction adapter is designed, which can cover a variety of user instructions as illustrated in this figure.
